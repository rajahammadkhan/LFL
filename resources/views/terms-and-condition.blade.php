    <p style="color:#000">2.2 You are only eligible to register for an LFL account if: (i) you are an individual who is at least eighteen (18) years old or of legal age in your country of residence if such age exceeds eighteen (18); or (ii) you are an individual whose registration has been authorized by your parents or legal guardian (if you are below the legal age in your respective country of residence).</p>
    <p style="color:#000">2.3 If you provide, or Legends Football League has reasonable grounds to suspect that you have provided, any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, Legends Football League reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse you access to any LFL Platform.</p>
